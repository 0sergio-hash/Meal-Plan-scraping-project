Below are the instrucitons I used to create a bat script for my meal plan project. 
I added conda to the environment variabe using instructions here https://www.quora.com/Why-can-t-I-run-Python-in-CMD-but-can-in-Anaconda-Prompt
I wrote a batch file that will activate the environment I created this script in, and import it, leaving the python interpreter open for me to call the functions

from what I know the -i is responsible for keeping python going after execution, and -c passes the quoted text as a python instruciton 

@ ECHO OFF keeps the instrucitons from printing to the screen as they're run,

and CLS simply clears the screen for me 

I use import * to get all functions and variables.
I also added a get_syntax() function that just prints the syntax for the get_meals() function in case I need it.

I also found that I could create a shortcut to the bat file on my desktop, change the icon by downloading an image and converting it to icon format
and changing it in properties.

The effect of all this is: I double click the icon, and cmd gets everything set up, so the next thing I need to do is simply
call the function with whatever parameters I need that day.

Here is the code:

@ ECHO OFF
CALL conda activate activate meal_plan1
CLS
CALL python -i -c "from get_meals import *"
